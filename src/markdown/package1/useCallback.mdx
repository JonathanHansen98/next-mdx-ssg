title: useCallback()
description: useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
---

Call `useCallback` at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:

```js
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies);
```

---

## Reference {/* reference */}

### `useContext(SomeContext)` {/* usecontext */}

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

```js
import { useContext } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/* parameters */}

- `SomeContext`: The context that you've previously created with [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext). The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.

#### Returns {/* returns */}

`useContext` returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the `value` passed to the closest `SomeContext.Provider` above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the `defaultValue` you have passed to [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext) for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

#### Caveats {/* caveats */}

- `useContext()` call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the _same_ component. The corresponding `<Context.Provider>` **needs to be _above_** the component doing the `useContext()` call.
- React **automatically re-renders** all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different `value`. The previous and the next values are compared with the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. Skipping re-renders with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.
- If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if `SomeContext` that you use to provide context and `SomeContext` that you use to read it are **_exactly_ the same object**, as determined by a `===` comparison.

## Usage {/* usage */}

### Passing data deeply into the tree {/* passing-data-deeply-into-the-tree */}

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

```js [[2, 4, "theme"], [1, 4, "ThemeContext"]]
import { useContext } from 'react';

function Button() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
```
